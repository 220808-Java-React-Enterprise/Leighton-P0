# GoMart

## Description

Have you just come home from a long day of training and dread the thought of leaving the house? Do you need to stock up before your gym battle but don't want to deal with the lines?<br>
<br>
At GoMart, we understand that our Kanto Trainers are busy people who don't always have time to browse around a physical store, spending precious time acclimating to a new store layout when they'd rather be off testing their strength. That's why we've partnered with our sellers across the region to bring you this fast, easy, and convenient online store to ensure that you have what you need to keep your pokemon battle-ready when you're out on the field. Whether you need to stock up on potions or pokeballs, GoMart is here for all your Poke-needs
