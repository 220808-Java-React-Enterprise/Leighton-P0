# GoMart

## Description

Have you just come home from a long day of training and dread the thought of leaving the house? Do you need to stock up before your gym battle but don't want to deal with the lines?<br>
<br>
At GoMart, we understand that our Kanto Trainers are busy people who don't always have time to browse around a physical store, spending precious time acclimating to a new store layout when they'd rather be off testing their strength. That's why we've partnered with our sellers across the region to bring you this fast, easy, and convenient online store to ensure that you have what you need to keep your pokemon battle-ready when you're out on the field. Whether you need to stock up on potions or pokeballs, GoMart is here for all your Poke-needs

### Usage

GoMart is incredibly simple to use, just follow the prompts as they appear on screen, pressing the appropriate key and then "Enter." GoMart will clearly direct you to where you need to go and provide you with all the information you need for a successful online shopping experience.<br>
<br>
When you create a new account, GoMart will walk you through the registration process, prompting you to fill out new information. Once you're satisfied with your account details, you'll be taken to the main store page, where you can view all the items we have available, conveniently separated into helpful categories
